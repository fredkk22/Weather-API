## Description

This Module 6 Challenge was to attempt to create a weather dashboard that called the current weather forecast and a forecast for the next 5 days. It would then record a search history up to 5 buttons.

The reason for creating this challenge was to learn more about API calls, working with bootstrap and jQuery, and local storage.

I was able to learn everything I listed above and have become much more comfortable using the tools listed above, especially the API calls. I am still struggling a bit to understand bootstrap, but I hope I will be able to understand it more through the group project. I also couldn't figure out how to call the API while clicking on the buttons when the search history is greater than 5.
